# Darxeal's TribalWars scripts

These scripts are against the game rules and can get you banned. Use at your own risk.

## How to use:
You have several options:
* If you have premium, you can use the scripts feature
* Save the script as a bookmark (just paste the script to the URL field)
* Paste the script into the browser console (press F12 to open it up)

## Attack timer
``javascript:$.getScript("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Darxeal/tribal-wars-scripts/attack_timer.js");``

You can specify when an attack should arrive, and the script will calculate, wait and send the attack at the right time for you. No more setting up alarms! :-)

## Farm bot
``javascript:$.getScript("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Darxeal/tribal-wars-scripts/farm_bot.js");``

## Map attack planner
``javascript:$.getScript("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Darxeal/tribal-wars-scripts/map_attacker/main.js");``
