# Darxeal's TribalWars scripts

These scripts are against the game rules and can get you banned. Use at your own risk.
If you find a bug or you have an idea for a new script, submit an issue [here](https://github.com/Darxeal/Darxeal.github.io/issues)

## How to use:
You have several options:
* If you have premium, you can use the quick access feature (not recommended)
* Save the script as a bookmark (just paste the script to the URL field)
* Paste the script into the browser console (press F12 to open it up)

## Attack scheduler
``javascript:$.getScript("https://darxeal.github.io/tribalwars_scripts/attack_timer.js");``

You can specify when an attack/support should arrive, and the script will calculate, wait and send it at the right time for you.
Works both in the Rally point and on the Map screen. 

## Farm bot
``javascript:$.getScript("https://darxeal.github.io/tribalwars_scripts/farm_bot.js");``

*Requires the Farming Assistant.*

The script will press the 'A' button on a number of villages in the farming assistant, every X minutes.
You can specify the interval and the maximum number of attacks sent each wave.
You can leave this running over night, and wake up with thousands of plundered villages :-)

## Map Commander
``javascript:$.getScript("https://darxeal.github.io/tribalwars_scripts/map_attacker/main.js");``

*Requires Premium.*

Same as the Attack timer, but more awesome. You can schedule as many commands as you want and only need one tab open.
It also visualises attack paths on the map!
